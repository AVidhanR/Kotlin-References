> In Kotlin, both `singleton objects` and `companion objects` are used to define objects associated with a class or type, 
but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here, I'll explain each of them with syntax and examples.

### Singleton Object :
A singleton object is an object that is declared using the `object` keyword. It is a single instance of the class, and it is created lazily when it's first accessed. Singleton objects are used to define global functions, properties, or to implement the Singleton design pattern. They cannot be instantiated explicitly, and their members can be accessed directly.

```kotlin
object MySingleton {
    val someProperty = "I'm a property in the singleton object"

    fun someFunction() {
        println("I'm a function in the singleton object")
    }
}

fun main() {
    println(MySingleton.someProperty)
    MySingleton.someFunction()
}
```

In the example above, `MySingleton` is a singleton object with a property and a function. 
You can access them using the object's name directly.

------

### Companion Object :
A companion object is a special object declared within a class. It's used to define members that are associated with the class rather than instances of the class itself. 
The companion object can have properties, functions, and is commonly used for defining factory methods or utility methods.

```kotlin
class MyClass {
    companion object {
        val someProperty = "I'm a property in the companion object"

        fun createInstance(): MyClass {
            return MyClass()
        }
    }
}

fun main() {
    println(MyClass.someProperty)
    val instance = MyClass.createInstance()
}
```

In this example, the `companion object` in the `MyClass` class contains a property and a factory method. 
You can access them using the class name (`MyClass`) as if they were static members. 
The companion object is associated with the class and not with instances of the class.

###  KeyPoints:

- Singleton Object:
  - Declared using the `object` keyword.
  - Represents a single instance.
  - Used for global functions and properties.
  - Created lazily when first accessed.
  - Accessed via the object's name.

- Companion Object:
  - Declared within a class using the `companion object` keyword.
  - Associated with the class, not instances of the class.
  - Commonly used for defining utility methods, factory methods, and class-level properties.
  - Accessed using the class name.

Both singleton objects and companion objects are powerful features in Kotlin, and they provide different ways to organize and encapsulate code within your classes. 
The choice between them depends on your specific use case and design requirements.
