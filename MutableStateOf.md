In Kotlin, `mutableStateOf()` is a function provided by the `state` library in the Jetpack Compose framework, commonly used for building UIs. It's used to create a mutable state variable that can be observed by Compose, triggering recomposition when the state changes.

Here's a basic example:

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.runtime.mutableStateOf
import androidx.compose.runtime.remember

fun MyComposable() {
    // Create a mutable state variable with an initial value
    var myState by remember { mutableStateOf(initialValue) }

    // Use myState in your Compose UI

    // Update the state variable
    myState = newValue
}
```

When the value of `myState` changes, Compose automatically triggers a recomposition of the relevant parts of the UI. This allows for a declarative way of handling UI updates based on state changes.

Remember that `mutableStateOf` is typically used within a Compose function (like `MyComposable` in the example) and should be accompanied by the `remember` function to ensure that the state is retained across recompositions.

Keep in mind that Jetpack Compose and its associated libraries may evolve, so it's always a good idea to refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date information.
